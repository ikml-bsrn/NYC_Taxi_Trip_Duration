# The Taxi Fares Predictor

This project aims to create a machine learning model which predicts fares from relevant attributes, a predictive model popularly and widely used by ride-hailing companies such as Uber, Veezu, and many more. This project serves as a passion project, where novelty is not particularly emphasised, but serves as a way for me to gain experience and apply my knowledge in practical context using real-world data.

In this project, attributes include, but not limited to:
- pick-up and drop-off dates/times
- pick-up and drop-off locations
- trip distances
- itemised fares
- rate types
- payment types
- driver-reported passenger counts
- tip amount
- airport fee
